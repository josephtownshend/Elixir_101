# What can you do with Elixir?

You can do anything from build web apps using the Phoenix framework to embed code on network devices.

It is a Functional concurrent language.

It has quite a familiar syntax to Ruby though coming from an OO background you do have to change the way you think.

* In OO your thinking revolves around objects whose state you can modify by calling methods.
* In Elixir all data in immutable so you think more in terms of transforming data with functions.

Throughout this course we will be building an HTTP web server which is a great way to learn Elixir.
