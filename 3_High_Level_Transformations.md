# High-Level Transformations

where do we put the module file?

by convention our application code lives in the lib directory, and by convention we have folder with that lib file called the same name as our project 'servy' - within that folder we have about application code.

by convention the module is name spaced inside of the module.

```
def module <app_name>.<module_name> do
end
```
